Programs required: it is recommended that the user has anaconda installed, through which all required programs can be installed. Assuming that anaconda is available, all the required programs can be installed using the following:

```
conda create -n flye -c bioconda -c conda-forge -c defaults flye

## Introduction
This pipeline is compatabile with reads generated by Oxford Nanopore or PacBio.

Before we run FastQC, you should be on a compute node in an interactive session. Please run the following srun command if you are not on a compute node. An interactive session is very useful to test tools and workflows.
```
srun --pty -t 0-6:00 --mem 5G /bin/bash
```

Now, after you are on interactive mode, develop the scripts required for analysis and submit the jobs using"
```
sbatch "filename.sh"
```

And, the squeue command is used to pull up information about jobs in the queue, by default this command will list the job ID, partition, username, job status, number of nodes, and name of nodes for all jobs queued or running within SLURM.
```
squeue -u username
```
And if you want to end the interactive mode type *exit*
